Python implementation of variants of Vehicle routing problem. 


> Abstract
The transition to sustainable food supply chain management has brought new key logistical aims
 such as reducing food waste and environmental impacts of operations in the supply chain besides
 the traditional cost minimization objective. Traditional assumptions of constant distribution costs 
between nodes, unlimited product shelf life and deterministic demand used in the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP)
 literature restrict the usage of the proposed models in current food logistics systems. From this point of view, our 
interest in this study is to enhance the traditional models for the IRP to make them more useful for the decision makers 
in food logistics management. Therefore, we present a multi-period IRP model that includes truck load dependent (and thus route dependent)
 distribution costs for a comprehensive evaluation of CO2 emission and fuel consumption, perishability, and a service level constraint for
 meeting uncertain demand. A case study on the fresh tomato distribution operations of a supermarket chain shows the applicability of the model
 to a real-life problem. Several variations of the model, each differing with respect to the considered aspects, are employed to present the
 benefits of including perishability and explicit fuel consumption concerns in the model. The results suggest that the proposed integrated model 
can achieve significant savings in total cost while satisfying the service level requirements and thus offers better support to decision makers.
